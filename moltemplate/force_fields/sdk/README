v0.1

This is only part of the SDK force field and is to be used for lipids only. Only parameters from:

Shinoda et al. J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 114, No. 20, 2010
http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp9107206

are used. This works for any topology built using the following types:

Name  Structure         Charge
NC    -CH2CH2-N-(CH3)3  +1
NH    -CH2CH2-NH3       +1
PH    -PO4-             -1
PHE   -PO4- (PE lipid)  -1
GL    -CH2CH-CH2-
EST1  -CH2CO2-
EST2  -H2CO2-
CMD2  -HC=CH- (cis)
CM    -CH2CH2CH2-
CT    CH3CH2CH2-
CT2   CH3CH2-
W     (H2O)3

This coarse-grainng allows for design of a wide variety of lipids.
