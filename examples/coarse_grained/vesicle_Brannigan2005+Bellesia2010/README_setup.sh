  # You must run each packmol commend one after the other.
  # NOTE: If PACKMOL gets stuck in an endless loop, then edit the corresponding
  # "inp" file.  This should not happen.  You can also usually interrupt
  # packmol after 30 minutes, and the solution at that point (an .xyz file)
  # should be good enough for use.
  packmol < step1_proteins.inp   # This step determines the protein's location
                                 # It takes ~40 minutes (on a 2015 intel i7)
  packmol < step2_innerlayer.inp # this step builds the inner monolayer
                                 # It takes ~5 hours
  packmol < step3_outerlayer.inp # this step builds the outer monolayer
                                 # It takes ~5 hours

  # NOTE: PLEASE USE "packmol", NOT "ppackmol".  ("ppackmol" is the parallel
  #       version of packmol using OpemMP.  This example has NOT been tested
  #       with "ppackmol".  Our impression was that the "ppackmol" version
  #       is more likely to get stuck in an infinite loop.  -Andrew 2015-8)

# Create LAMMPS input files this way:
cd moltemplate_files

  # run moltemplate

  # (Note: we use the final .xyz file we created earlier.)
  moltemplate.sh -xyz ../packmol_files/step3_outerlayer.xyz system.lt

  # This will generate various files with names ending in *.in* and *.data.
  # These files are the input files directly read by LAMMPS.  Move them to
  # the parent directory (or wherever you plan to run the simulation).

  mv -f system.in* system.data ../

  # The "table_int.dat" file contains tabular data for the lipid INT-INT atom
  # 1/r^2 interaction.  We need it too. (This slows down the simulation by x2,
  # so I might look for a way to get rid of it later.)
  cp -f table_int.dat ../

  # Optional:
  # The "./output_ttree/" directory is full of temporary files generated by
  # moltemplate.  They can be useful for debugging, but are usually thrown away.
  rm -rf output_ttree/
