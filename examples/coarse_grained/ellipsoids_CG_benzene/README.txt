# CG model of benzene where each molecule is represented as an ellipsoid
# and the intermolecular interactions are described with the Gay-Berne potential
#
# Do not expect realistic behaviour from this example.
# The long-range electrostatic interactions are missing.
#
# This example was provided by Otello M. Roscion and Matteo Ricci

# (Many thanks for editing and debugging moltemplate code to get this working!)
